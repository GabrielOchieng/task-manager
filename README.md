This repository contains the frontend code for a task management website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with authentication and authorization functionalities.

This repository specifically focuses on the frontend components and functionalities of the web application.

<h1> Features: </h1>
User Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for creating, managing, and viewing tasks.
Interactive Elements: Implements interactive features like drag-and-drop task reordering, checkboxes for marking tasks complete, and intuitive buttons for task actions.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes for optimal user experience across devices.
Data Visualization: May include charts or graphs to visualize task progress and user activity (data fetching and visualization logic typically handled on the backend).
Technologies Used:
React: (https://reactjs.org/) - For building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Redux Toolkit: (https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - For efficient state management and handling complex application logic.
React Router: (https://reacttraining.com/react-router) - For managing user navigation and routing within the application.
React Toastify: (https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/) - For displaying user notifications and feedback messages.
React Icons: (https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) - For providing a variety of icons to enhance the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - For rapid and responsive web UI development with a utility-first approach.

**Note:**

Authentication, authorization logic, and data fetching are typically handled by the backend API (https://github.com/GabrielOchieng/task-manager-api).
This frontend code interacts with the backend API using mechanisms like fetch or Axios for data communication.
Development Setup:
Clone the repository: Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://<your_github_username>@github.com/<your_repository_name>.git.
Install dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to install all required dependencies.
Development Server: Run npm run dev to start the development server. This will launch the application in your browser for live updates as you make code changes.
Build for Production: Run npm run build to create an optimized production build of the frontend code.
Linting: Run npm run lint to check your code for potential errors and style inconsistencies.
Further Development:

For a complete functional application, you'll need to integrate this frontend code with the backend API (separate repository) that handles user authentication, authorization, data storage, and server-side logic.
